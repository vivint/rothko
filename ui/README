# UI

This folder contains the front end for the rothko system. It is written in
Elm and makes external calls to a Gopherjs compiled library.

## Hacking

Source the .setup script to have it add some values to your path. Afterward,
you can run `roth onboard` to have it install the required set of npm
dependencies, and `roth live` to have it spin up a live server.

The `roth` command by itself will show a list of available commands.

- Note: on OS X you may have to `brew install bash` or similar to get a new
enough bash interpreter for the `roth gopher` command.
