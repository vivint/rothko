# UI

This folder contains the front end for the rothko system. It is written in Elm.

## Hacking

Source the .setup script at the root of the repo to have it add some values
to your path. Afterward, you can run `roth onboard` to have it install the
required set of npm dependencies, and `roth live` to have it spin up a live
server. Any changes to the Elm code will cause a rebuild and the page will
automatically reload.

The `roth` command by itself will show a list of available commands.
