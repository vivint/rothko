# TODO

- Some default implementation of an acceptrix
- Perhaps some other ones that poll prometheus?
- Perhaps some other ones that poll prometheous enabled servers?
- Get rid of DistributionKind in favor of strings
- Provide a way to specify a default distribution kind if none are found
- Perhaps don't worry about providing a default and just hard depend on random
