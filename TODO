# TODO

- Some default implementation of an acceptrix
- Perhaps some other ones that poll prometheus?
- Perhaps some other ones that poll prometheous enabled servers?
- Get rid of DistributionKind in favor of strings
- Exponential decay merging
- Multiple agg buffers for scribble for moving distributions
- Write docs for all exported things in rothko
- Clean up dumper code some
- Ensure package import constraints are on all the packages (or don't).
- Redo the draw package to draw backwards iteratively
- Maybe the draw package is in charge of merging to get up to a pixel?
